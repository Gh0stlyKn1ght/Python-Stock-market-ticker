# Python-Stock-market-ticker

To create a stock market ticker that shows the top 10 stocks in real time, you will need access to a real-time stock market data feed. There are many different providers of real-time stock market data, and each one has its own API that you can use to access the data. For this example, let's use the IEX Cloud API, which offers a free trial for developers.

To use the IEX Cloud API, you will first need to sign up for an account and obtain an API token. Once you have your API token, you can use the following Python code to fetch the top 10 stocks from the IEX Cloud API and display them in real time:

This code will make a request to the IEX Cloud API every second to fetch the top 10 most active stocks, and then print the stock data to the console. You can customize this code to display the data in a different format, or to add additional functionality such as support for different market indices or historical data.
